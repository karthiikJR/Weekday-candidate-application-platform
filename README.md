# Weekday Candidate Application Platform

As the project was small, I didn't add the API endpoint to the .env file.

Due to the unavailability of Tech stack data from the API request, the tech stack filter could not be added.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Download the ZIP file or clone it locally:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

3. Open the terminal in that folder and install all the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. After installation, run the project locally:

```bash
npm run dev
```

5. Finally, open your favourite browser and go to [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) to view the platform.

## Usage

- Use the search bar to find specific job listings.
- Use the filters to refine job listings based on different criteria.
- Scroll down the page to automatically load more job listings using infinite scroll.

## Technologies Used

- React.js (Frontend Framework)
- Redux toolkit (State Management)
- CSS & MUI (for styling)
- In-built fetch call (for API requests)
